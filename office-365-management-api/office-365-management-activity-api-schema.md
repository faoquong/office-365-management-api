# Office 365 Management Activity API schema
 
The Office 365 Management Activity API schema is provided as a data service in  two layers:

- **Common schema**. The interface to access core Office 365 auditing concepts such as Record Type, Creation Time, User Type, and Action as well as to provide core dimensions (such as User ID), location specifics (such as Client IP address), and product-specific properties (such as Object ID). It establishes consistent and uniform views for users to extract all Office 365 audit data in a few top level views with the appropriate parameters, and provides a fixed schema for all the data sources, which significantly reduces the cost of learning. Common schema is sourced from product data that is owned by each product team, such as Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Active Directory, Yammer, and OneDrive for Business. The Object ID field can be extended by product teams to add product specific properties.
    
- **Product-specific schema**. Built on top of the Common schema to provide a set of product-specific attributes; for example, Sway schema, SharePoint schema, OneDrive for Business schema, and Exchange admin schema.
    
**Which layer should you use for your scenario?**
In general, if the data is available in a higher layer, don't go back to a lower layer. In other words, if the data requirement can be fit in a product-specific schema, you don't need to go back to the Common schema.

## Common schema

**EntityType Name**: AuditRecord

|Parameter|Type|Mandatory?|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Id|Combination GUIDEdm.Guid|Yes|Unique identifier of an audit record.|
|RecordType|Self.[AuditLogRecordType](#auditlogrecordtype)|Yes|The type of operation indicated by the record. See the [AuditLogRecordType](#auditlogrecordtype) table for details on the types of audit log records.|
|CreationTime|Edm.Date|Yes|The date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when the user performed the activity.|
|Operation|Edm.String|Yes|The name of the user or admin activity. For a description of the most common operations/activities, see [Search the audit log in the Office 365 Protection Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708432). For Exchange admin activity, this property identifies the name of the cmdlet that was run. For Dlp events, this can be "DlpRuleMatch", "DlpRuleUndo" or "DlpInfo", which are described under "DLP schema" below.|
|OrganizationId|Edm.Guid|Yes|The GUID for your organization's Office 365 tenant. This value will always be the same for your organization, regardless of the Office 365 service in which it occurs.|
|UserType|Self.[UserType](#user-type)|Yes|The type of user that performed the operation. See the [UserType](#user-type) table for details on the types of users.|
|UserKey|Edm.String|Yes|An alternative ID for the user identified in the UserId property. For example, this property is populated with the passport unique ID (PUID) for events performed by users in SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange. This property may also specify the same value as the UserID property for events occurring in other services and events performed by system accounts.|
|Workload|Edm.String|No|The Office 365 service where the activity occurred. 
|ResultStatus|Edm.String|No|Indicates whether the action (specified in the Operation property) was successful or not. Possible values are **Succeeded**, **PartiallySucceeded**, or **Failed**. For Exchange admin activity, the value is either **True** or **False**.<br/><br/>**Important**: Different workloads may overwrite the value of the ResultStatus property. For example, for Azure Active Directory STS logon events, a value of **Succeeded** for ResultStatus indicates only that the HTTP operation was successful; it doesn't mean the logon was successful. To determine if the actual logon was successful or not, see the LogonError property in the [Azure Active Directory STS Logon schema](#azure-active-directory-secure-token-service-sts-logon-schema). If the logon failed, the value of this property will contain the reason for the failed logon attempt. |
|ObjectId|Edm.string|No|For SharePoint and OneDrive for Business activity, the full path name of the file or folder accessed by the user. For Exchange admin audit logging, the name of the object that was modified by the cmdlet.|
|UserId|Edm.string|Yes|The UPN (User Principal Name) of the user who performed the action (specified in the Operation property) that resulted in the record being logged; for example, `my_name@my_domain_name`. Note that records for activity performed by system accounts (such as SHAREPOINT\system or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are also included.|
|ClientIP|Edm.String|Yes|The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.<br/><br/>For some services, the value displayed in this property might be the IP address for a trusted application (for example, Office on the web apps) calling into the service on behalf of a user and not the IP address of the device used by person who performed the activity. <br/><br/>Also, for Azure Active Directory-related events, the IP address isn't logged and the value for the ClientIP property is `null`.|
|Scope|Self.[AuditLogScope](#auditlogscope)|No|Was this event created by a hosted O365 service or an on-premises server? Possible values are **online** and **onprem**. Note that SharePoint is the only workload currently sending events from on-premises to O365.|

## DLP schema

DLP events are available for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive For Business. Note that DLP events in Exchange are only available for events based on unified DLP policy (e.g. configured via Security & Compliance Center). DLP events based on Exchange Transport Rules are not supported.

DLP (Data Loss Prevention) events will always have UserKey="DlpAgent" in the common schema. There are three types of DlpEvents that are stored as the value of the Operation property of the common schema:

- DlpRuleMatch - This indicates a rule was matched. These events exist in both Exchange and SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. For Exchange it includes false positive and override information. For SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, false positive and overrides generate separate events.

- DlpRuleUndo - These only exist in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, and indicate a previously applied policy action has been “undone” – either because of false positive/override designation by user, or because the document is no longer subject to policy (either due to policy change or change to content in doc).

- DlpInfo - These only exist in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business and indicate a false positive designation but no action was “undone.”

## Security and Compliance Alerts schema

Alert signals include:

- All alerts generated based on [Alert policies in Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/alert-policies#default-alert-policies).
- Office 365 related alerts generated in [Office 365 Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-cas-overview) and [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security).

The UserId and UserKey of these events are always SecurityComplianceAlerts. There are two types of alert signals which are stored as the value of the Operation property of the common schema:

- AlertTriggered - A new alert is generated due to a policy match.

- AlertEntityGenerated - A new entity is added to an alert. This event is only applicable to alerts generated based on Alert policies in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. Each generated alert can be associated with one or multiple of these events. For example, an alert policy is defined to trigger an alert if any user deletes more than 100 files in 5 minutes. If two users exceed the threshold around the same time, there will be two AlertEntityGenerated events, but only one AlertTriggered event.

## Automated investigation and response events in Office 365

[Office 365 automated investigation and response (AIR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/automated-investigation-response-office) events are available for Office 365 customers who have a subscription that includes Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 2 or Office 365 E5. Investigation events are logged based on a change in investigation status. For example, when an administrator takes an action that changes the status of an investigation from Pending Actions to Completed, an event is logged. 

Currently, only automated investigation are logged. (Events for manually generated investigations are coming soon.) The following status values are logged:

- Investigation Started
- No threats found 
- Terminated by System
- Pending Action 
- Threats Found 
- Remediated 
- Failed 
- Terminated by throttling 
- Terminated By User
- Running
